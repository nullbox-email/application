## Recommended alias

- `amazon@your-domain.com`

## Steps

::steps
### 1) Create (or enable) the alias
Make sure it forwards to your real mailbox.

If your aliases filter unknown senders, turn on Learning Mode for the migration.

### 2) Change your Amazon email
In Amazon, go to **Your Account** → **Login & security** and look for **Email**.

Replace your old email with the alias.

### 3) Verify
Amazon will usually send a verification message (link or code) to the new address.

Complete the verification from your mailbox.

### 4) Watch the next few messages
Order confirmations and delivery updates should now arrive via the alias.

If you have multiple Amazon regions/accounts, migrate them one at a time so you don’t lose access while verifying.
