## Recommended alias

- `hulu@<your-routing-key>.nullbox.email`

## Before you start (1 minute)

- Make sure the alias is **enabled** and forwarding to your real inbox.
- If your alias filters unknown senders, turn on **Learning Mode** for this migration.

## Steps

::steps
### Open your Hulu Account page (browser)
On a web or mobile browser, go to your Hulu **Account** page.

### Try to change the email
Look for **Email** (or **Email & Password**) and update it to your alias.

### If you can’t change it yourself
Some Hulu accounts require contacting support to change the email. Use Hulu **Contact Us** and request an email change.

### Verify and re-check logins
Complete any verification.

Hulu is tied to a **MyDisney** login, so changing email/password may also affect other Disney-family services. Confirm sign-in still works where you use it.
