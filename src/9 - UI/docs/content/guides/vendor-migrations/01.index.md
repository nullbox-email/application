Vendor-specific aliases help you:

- Stop spam by disabling one alias (without breaking everything else)
- See who leaked your address
- Keep your real mailbox address private

Keep these handy during the change: your password manager, your phone (2FA), and access to your old email until the new email is verified.

## The simple migration checklist

::steps
### Create the alias
Make one alias per vendor, for example:
- `amazon@<your-routing-key>.nullbox.email`
- `netflix@<your-routing-key>.nullbox.email`

Make sure it forwards to your real inbox.

### Make sure you won’t miss the first verification email
When you change an email on a vendor account, they usually send a verification link/code.

If your aliases quarantine unknown senders:
- temporarily enable **Learning Mode** (or **Direct Passthrough**) on that alias

### Update the email on the vendor account
In the vendor’s **Account / Login / Security** settings:
- replace your old email with the alias

### Verify immediately
Open the verification email sent to the alias and complete the link/code step right away.

::alert{type="warning" title="If you don’t see the verification email" icon="lucide:triangle-alert"}
1) Confirm the alias is enabled and forwarding  
2) Check spam/quarantine on your alias  
3) Retry “resend code” on the vendor site/app  

Advanced: if you administer the system, check the delivery decision logs for the message.
::

### Confirm you can still sign in
Do a quick sign-out/sign-in (or open the app on your phone/TV) to ensure the change worked.

### Tighten security again
If you enabled Learning Mode / Passthrough:
- turn it back off after you see a few real vendor emails arriving
